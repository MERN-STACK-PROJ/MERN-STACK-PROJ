GitHub Copilot: To convert your JavaScript backend server to TypeScript, you can follow these steps:

1. Install TypeScript: First, you need to install TypeScript as a development dependency in your project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install --save-dev typescript`.

2. Create a tsconfig.json file: Next, you need to create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the TypeScript compiler options for your project. You can create a basic `tsconfig.json` file by running the following command in your terminal: `npx tsc --init`.

3. Rename your JavaScript files to TypeScript files: Rename your `.js` files to `.ts` files. This will allow TypeScript to recognize your files as TypeScript files.

4. Update your code to use TypeScript syntax: Update your code to use TypeScript syntax, such as adding type annotations to your variables and functions.

5. Install TypeScript type definitions: If you are using external libraries in your project, you may need to install TypeScript type definitions for those libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install --save-dev @types/library-name`.

6. Update your build process: Update your build process to use the TypeScript compiler instead of the JavaScript compiler. You can do this by updating your `package.json` file to include a build script that runs the TypeScript compiler.

7. Test your code: Finally, test your code to make sure that it works as expected.

Here's an example of what your updated `index.ts` file might look like:

```typescript
import express from "express";
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const app = express();

// GET method available at "/"
app.get("/", (request: express.Request, response: express.Response) => {
  response.status(200).send("Welcome to my Express.js backend server!");
});

// Connect to MongoDB database
// If connection is successful, start Express.js backend server
mongoose
  .connect(mongoDBURL)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("App connected successfully to the database!");

    // Start Express.js server and listen to port 5555
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`App is listening to port ${PORT}`);
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Mongoose connect error in index.ts: ", error);
  });
```

Remember to update your `tsconfig.json` file to include any additional TypeScript compiler options that you need for your project.
